      { title: "WasteAge", column: 3, image: "images/WasteAge Mon Wide.jpg", description: "Spin’s design of the Waste Age exhibition at the London Design Museum boldly confronted the pressing issue of global waste through arresting graphic design and innovative exhibition techniques. They crafted a visual language that underscored both the scale of the problem and the potential for design-led solutions. A central feature was the use of a repurposed typeface, a clever nod to the exhibition’s themes of reuse and recycling. The graphics were both striking and thought-provoking, designed to provoke reflection and challenge visitors’ assumptions about consumption and waste. Spin’s work elevated the exhibition from a simple presentation of facts into a dynamic, immersive experience that inspired audiences to imagine new possibilities for sustainable futures and rethink their relationship with materials and waste." },

Soft, warm tones combined with simple, elegant typography to create an aesthetic that promotes clarity and serenity.
